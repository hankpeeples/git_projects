# 1. ( PEP Guidlines ) {

    - imports always go at the top of the code.
    only time you can separate with commas is with importing module
    ex. 
        from MyModule import foo, bar, foobar

    - drop 2 lines before starting actual code

    - drop 2 lines between defining functions
}

## 2. ( Comments ) {

    # = single line

    ''' = multi-line
