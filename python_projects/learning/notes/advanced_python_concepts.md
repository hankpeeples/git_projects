# 1. ( PEP Guidlines ) {

    - imports always go at the top of the code.
    only time you can separate with commas is with importing module
    ex. 
        from MyModule import foo, bar, foobar

    - drop 2 lines before starting actual code

    - drop 2 lines between defining functions
}

## 2. ( Comments ) {

    # = single line
    
    ''' 
    ''' = multi-line
}

### 3. ( Importing Modules from relative paths ) {

    Should't define classes in main file; gets messy.
    classes folder should have file called __init__.py 
}
